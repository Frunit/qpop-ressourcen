Q-POP resources
===============

The game Q-POP was published in 1995 by *von Wendt Konzept GmbH* in Germany. There is an English version of the game that was never published. However, an unfinished but playable English version exists. You can find it [here](qpop_v1.02E.zip).

This repository holds all resources of the game, including pictures, background music, and sound effects. Since the game was only published in German and supposedly all fans understand German, I decided to keep this repository also in that language.

The licence is somewhat unclear. The original company does not exist anymore. Please only use the assets here in fair use and definitely not for commercial products.
