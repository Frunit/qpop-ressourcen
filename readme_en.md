Q-POP resources
===============

The game Q-POP was published in 1995 by *von Wendt Konzept GmbH* in Germany. Although there are rumours about an English version, I have never seen one. If you should possess an English copy of the game, I would be very happy if you could send it to me!

This repository holds all resources of the game, including pictures, background music, and sound effects. Since the game is German and supposedly all fans understand German, I decided to keep this repository also in that language.

The licence is somewhat unclear. The original company does not exist anymore. Please only use the assets here in fair use and definitely not for commercial products.
